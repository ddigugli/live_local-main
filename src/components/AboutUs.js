      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Live Local was created to make it easier for people everywhere to discover and support locally owned businesses. When searching for a place to eat, shop, or find services, it’s often difficult to tell which options are truly local—making it harder for communities to support the businesses that give their neighborhoods character. Our mission is to change that.</p>

<p>Live Local helps you quickly find locally owned cafés, shops, services, and experiences right around you, strengthening community connections through local commerce.</p>

<p>After signing in, you can explore businesses near your location by category, leave reviews for others to see, and personalize your profile with your interests and location. If you’re a business owner, you can use the Apply tab to submit your locally owned business to our map—this is how all businesses on Live Local are added. Our users and local owners help shape the map, ensuring it stays authentic, community-driven, and up to date.</p>
