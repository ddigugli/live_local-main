      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome! Live Local is a website designed to help people across the globe discover and support local businesses. So often it can be hard to easily determine which businesses are locally owned and operated when searching for a place to eat or shop - making it harder to support and keep them running. Our purpose is to make it easy to find locally owned cafes, shops, services, and experiences right around you, and to strengthen community connections through local commerce.</p>
      <p>After signing in, you can explore local businesses near your location based on your selected category of business type. You can also leave reviews on a business for other Live Local users to see. Additionally you can manage your profile - updating your interests, current location, etc. Owners of local businesses can also use the Apply Tab to submit their buisness to our map for other users to then see. Lastly, our simple CRM tool allows you to keep track of your interactions with local companies.</p>
